- Context: Update CA1 PlantUML (iterate from CA0) and align with CS5287 CA1 requirements.

Request
- Use CA0 diagram style as reference.
- Reflect IaC automation (Terraform/Ansible), idempotency, parameterization, secrets, and deploy/destroy.

Decisions
- Keep pipeline identical to CA0; only change the cloud modality (automation).
- Show Terraform → VMs and Ansible → software roles; include Secrets Manager and Vars collections.

Tradeoffs
- Terraform+Ansible split over single-tool approach: clearer responsibilities vs. more moving parts.
- Secrets via Vault/SM vs. environment files: stronger controls vs. setup complexity.

AI Assistance
- Copilot drafted the updated diagram and summary using CS5287 CA1 rubric as guidance.

Next
- If accepted, we will add IaC skeletons in a future PR; this PR focuses on documentation and diagrams.
