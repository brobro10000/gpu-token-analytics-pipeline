- Context: Update CA2 PlantUML to an orchestrated deployment (Kubernetes), per CS5287 CA2.

Request
- Iterate from CA0/CA1 using the same visual style; show StatefulSets, Deployments, Services, PVCs, ConfigMaps/Secrets, and optional Ingress.

Decisions
- Use KRaft Kafka (no ZooKeeper) to simplify the cluster diagram.
- Represent producers as Job/CronJob and processor as a Deployment (replicas=2) with a ClusterIP Service.

Tradeoffs
- Single-broker SS for simplicity vs. production realism (multi-broker).
- Optional Ingress for /health to keep ports minimal in lab environments.

AI Assistance
- Copilot aligned elements to CS5287 CA2 checklist and prior CA0 style.

Next
- Provide manifest skeletons as a separate change; this PR updates diagrams and summaries only.
