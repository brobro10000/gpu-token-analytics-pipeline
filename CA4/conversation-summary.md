- Context: Extend CA2 to multi/hybrid across two sites with secure connectivity and replication.

Request
- Show two sites/clusters, secure connectivity (VPN/mesh/bastion), MirrorMaker2 for Kafka topics, and either DB replica set or backup/restore.

Decisions
- Prefer WireGuard-based VPN where possible (simplicity, no-cost); otherwise document bastion tunnels.
- Keep active/active topics conceptually via MM2 while leaving DB strategy flexible.

Tradeoffs
- MM2 simplicity vs. complex cross-cluster Kafka alternatives.
- DB replica set realism vs. course-lab constraints (backup/restore acceptable).

AI Assistance
- Copilot produced the diagram and summary from CS5287 CA4 rubric and roadmap.

Next
- In a subsequent branch, include WireGuard and MM2 example configs; this PR documents the design.
